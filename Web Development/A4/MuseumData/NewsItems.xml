         <title>Techno pioneer thanks teacher who began it all</title>
         <description>Dave Jaggar's career was so successful it lasted only nine years. Having made a fortune helping revolutionise the technology industry, the Kiwi computer engineer's only occupation for the past 14 years has been raising his three children. All the while, though, one goal has remained outstanding - saying cheers to the professor who made it all possible.</description>

         <title>Racetrack Betting Mechanized At Computer History Museum</title>
         <description>On Tuesday, July 16, 2013, a group of almost seventy people attended a CHM SoundByte lunchtime lecture entitled The Totalisator â€“ An Algorithm That Led to an Industry delivered by Prof Bob Doran. Bob Doran is a computing veteran with a Silicon Valley stint as Principal Computer Architect at Amdahl Corporation from 1976 to 1982; he is an educator who taught The City University London and Massey University in New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, he was the Head of Department and Professor of Computer Science at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Like many people in the field, Bob has been fascinated by its history and in recent years his curiosity has shifted towards the deeply antipodean story of totalisators.</description>
